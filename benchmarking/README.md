### Benchmarking Folder
The `benchmarking` folder contains scripts and datasets used for SANDPUMA benchmarking in this project.

- `benchmarking_sample.py`: This is the benchmarking script itself. You can run it using `python3 benchmarking_sample.py`.

- `ADD_benchmarking_dataset.tsv`: This dataset consists of A-domains from the ADD database and is used for benchmarking. It contains 439 entries.

- `sandpuma_predictions.tsv`: This dataset includes predictions for A-domains and their specificities generated by the SANDPUMA ensemble. It also includes predictions from other tools, specifically NRPSsp (pHMM) and NRPSpredictor2 (ASM and SVM). This is an output of `sandpuma_parser.py`.

- `prf_metrics_micro_all.tsv`: This is a TSV output file generated by `benchmarking_sample.py`.

- `sandpuma_parser.py`: This script is used to parse SANDPUMA predictions and format them into a proper table.

- `sandpuma_basic_output.tsv`: This file serves as input for `sandpuma_parser.py` and contains all SANDPUMA predictions merged into a single TSV file.

- `specificities_dict.txt`: This text file contains short names of substrates (in the format of SANDPUMA predictions) along with their long names (added manually).
